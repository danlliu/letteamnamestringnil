Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an Effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an Effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an Effect. d100 — Effect: 01 — 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take Sd6 poison damage and become Poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour. 2-10 — A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (DM's choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds. 11-20 — A Treant sprouts (see the Monster Manual for statistics). There's a 50 percent chance that the Treant is chaotic evil and attacks. 21-30 — An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of Villains and directs the newcomers to find and Attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours. 31-40 — A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished). 41-50 — 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout (see the Monster Manual for statistics). 51-60 — 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is Touched , it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the DM's choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke. 61-70 — A hungry Bulette (see the Monster Manual for statistics) burrows up and attacks. 71-80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10+20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic Potions , while one acts as an ingested poison of the DM's choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days. 81-90 — A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion. 91-99 — A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a Mummy Lord (see the Monster Manual for statistics). The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord's lair, and its sarcophagus contains Treasure of the DM's choice. 00 — A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the DM's choice. The top leads where the DM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant's castle, or a different plane of existence.",

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate. Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack , Portable Hole , or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random Location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A Sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this Sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the Sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No Attack or other Effect can. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the Sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The Sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.",

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you. An Illusion of one or more creatures forms over the Thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the Monster Manual), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an Illusion , because Objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent. The Illusion lasts until its card is moved or the Illusion is dispelled. When the Illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.

        "Description": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no Effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes Effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take Effect all at once. Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. Playing Card — Card: Ace of diamonds — Vizier* King of diamonds — Sun Queen of diamonds — Moon Jack of diamonds — Star Two of diamonds — Comet* Ace of hearts — The Fates* King of hearts — Throne Queen of hearts — Key Jack of hearts — Knight Two of hearts — Gem* Ace of clubs — Talons* King of clubs — The Void Queen of clubs — Flames Jack of clubs — Skull Two of clubs — Idiot* Ace of spades — Donjon* King of spades — Ruin Queen of spades — Euryale Jack of spades — Rogue Two of spades — Balance* Joker (with TM) — Fool* Joker (without TM) — Jester * Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards Balance: Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your Alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no Effect on you. Comet: If you single-handedly defeat the next Hostile monster or group of Monsters you encounter, you gain Experience Points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no Effect. Donjon: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional Sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the Sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the Location of your prison. You draw no more cards. Euryale: The card's medusa-like visage Curses you. You take a -2 penalty on Saving Throws while Cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse. The Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. Flames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. Fool: You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level. Gem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet. Idiot: Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. Jester: You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. Key: A rare or rarer Magic Weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon. Knight: You gain the service of a 4th-level Fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The Fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character. Moon: You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times. Rogue: A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or Divine Intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. Ruin: All forms of Wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items , are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses , buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. Skull: You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly Humanoid  Skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 Hit Points , whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own Avatar of Death. A creature slain by an Avatar of Death can't be restored to life. Star: Increase one of your Ability Scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24. Sun: You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands. Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do Vanish. Throne: You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your Proficiency Bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of Monsters , which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as. yours. Vizier: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with Wisdom on how to apply it. The Void: This black card Spells  Disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is Incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the Location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.",

You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to Command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine.

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The Backpack always weighs 5 pounds regardless of its contents. Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with Objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turn up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random Location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from The Helm. • As long as it has at least one Diamond , The Helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one Undead is within that area. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage. • As long as The Helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to fire damage. • As long as The Helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a Command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an Attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a Bonus Action to speak the Command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon. Roll a d20 if you are wearing The Helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, The Helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of The Helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in The Helm.

The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a Ladder running along one wall to connect them. The Ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your Command , which you can speak as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a Chime of Opening. Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically. The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 Hit Points , immunity to damage from nonmagical Weapons excluding siege Weapons , and Resistance to all other damage. Only a wish  spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish  causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 Hit Points.",

On a hit, the target is Restrained until you take a Bonus Action to speak the Command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the Attack , causes the bands to contract and become a Sphere once more. A creature, including the one Restrained , can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the Restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed. Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.",

If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age. You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that Duration. If you give no commands or give it a Command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no Actions. At the end of the Duration , the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and Alignment. An Identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask.

        "Description": "When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 Hit Points , and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its Command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the Command word again. Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's Nature , and Constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically. An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces Visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can Escape using magic that permits planar Travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed. If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally. In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second Command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.",

        "Description": "Requires Attunement Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and Humans waged a terrible war against evil Dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the Dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure Dragons to them, then destroyed the Dragons with powerful magic. As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary Purpose of calling Dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over Dragons. Each orb contains the essence of an evil Dragon , a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of Personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb. An orb is an etched Crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it. While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its Command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become Charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. While you are Charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The Dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the Worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides. Random Properties: An Orb of Dragon kind has the following random properties: • 2 minor beneficial Properties • 1 minor detrimental property • 1 major detrimental property Spells: The orb has 7 Charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more Charges to cast one of the following Spells (save DC 18) from it: Cure Wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), Daylight (1 charge), Death Ward (2 charges), or Scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the Detect Magic spell from the orb without using any Charges. Call Dragons: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a Telepathic call that extends in all Directions for 40 miles. Evil Dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour. Destroying an Orb: An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath Weapons of Dragons. A Disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 Magic Weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",

If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a Bonus Action to expend 1 to 3 Charges , calling forth one Swarm of Rats (see the Monster Manual for statistics) with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended Charges daily at dawn. Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no Actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.",

        "Description": "This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter. You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open Passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it. You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or Objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding , Handy Haversack , or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random Location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no Effect on that spell. When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored. If you are a Spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into Spell Slots to cast Spells you have prepared or know. You can create Spell Slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own Spell Slots , up to a maximum of 5th Level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot. A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.",

The rod has Properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other Properties as well, detailed below. Six Buttons: You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a Bonus Action. A button's Effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form. If you press button 1, the rod becomes a Flame Tongue as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head. If you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with it. If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a+3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with it. If you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a Ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form. If you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and gram its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers. If you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a Location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it. Drain Life: When you hit a creature with a melee Attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. Paralyze: When you hit a creature with a melee Attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is Paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, Ending the Effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. Terrify: While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is Frightened of you for 1 minute. A Frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, Ending the Effect on itself on a success.

The Sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of annihilation, it passes through the Sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the Sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage. The Sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled Sphere , you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the Sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the Sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the Sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be Touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage. If you attempt to control a Sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the Sphere and can Levitate it as normal. If the Sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a Portable Hole , the DM determines randomly what happens, using the following table. d100 — Result: 01-50 — The Sphere is destroyed. 51-85 — The Sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. 86-00 — A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the Sphere , including the Sphere , to a random plane of existence.",

        "Description": "Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster This wand has 7 Charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its Charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens. If the Effect causes you to Cast a Spell from the wand, the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn't already. If an Effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an Effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM randomly determines which ones are affected. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended Charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed. d100 — Effect: 01-05 — You cast slow. 06-10 — You cast Faerie Fire. 11-15 — You are Stunned until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened. 16-20 — You cast Gust of Wind. 21-25 — You cast Detect Thoughts on the target you chose. If you didn't target a creature, you instead take 1d6 psychic damage. 26-30 — You cast Stinking Cloud. 31-33 — Heavy rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes lightly obscured. The rain falls until the start of your next turn. 34-36 — An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target. The animal isn't under your control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100 to determine which animal appears. On a 01-25, a Rhinoceros appears; on a 26-50, an Elephant appears; and on a 51-100, a rat appears. See the Monster Manual for the animal's Statistics. 37-46 — You cast Lightning Bolt. 47-49 — A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30-foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes. 50-53 — You enlarge the target as if you had cast enlarge/reduce. If the target can't be affected by that spell or if you didn't target a creature, you become the target. 54-58 — You cast Darkness. 59-62 — Grass grows on the ground in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. If grass is already there, it grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute. 63-65 — An object of the DM 's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the target, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. 66-69 — You shrink yourself as if you had cast enlarge/ reduce on yourself. 70-79 — You cast Fireball. 80-84 — You cast Invisibility on yourself. 85-87 — Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in space as the target, leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours. 88-90 — A stream of 1 d4 x 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the wand 's tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line. 91-95 — A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become Blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, Ending the Effect on itself on a success. 96-97 — The target's skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected. 98-00 — If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you didn't target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly Petrified. On any other failed save, the target is Restrained and begins to turn to stone. While Restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming Petrified on a failure or Ending the Effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.",
